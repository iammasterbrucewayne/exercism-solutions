# Exercism Solutions

A collection of solutions for the [Exercism Language Tracks](https://exercism.org/tracks).

The goal is to provide clean, idiomatic implementations that can help
learn core concepts for programming languages like C++/Rust.

## Repository Layout

Each exercise lives in its own folder:

```
cpp
├── hello-world/
├── lasagna/
└── …
```
